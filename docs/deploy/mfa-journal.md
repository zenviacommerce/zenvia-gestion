# MFA deployment journal — 2026-10-18

Status: **STOPPED / awaiting explicit Phase A approval**. No MFA activation or new deployment is authorized in this phase.

## Exact production reconciliation
- 20261016191517 — admin_mfa_security; SQL equals the repository migration exactly.
- 20261016194211 — admin_mfa_oauth_actor_binding; exact SQL match.
- 20261017192500 — admin_mfa_adaptive_recovery; exact SQL match.
- 20261018092127 (2026-10-18 **09:21:27 UTC**, 11:21:27 Madrid) — rollback_admin_mfa_pre_activation; the registered SQL matches the separately saved rollback script exactly (185,325 characters).
- The last script explicitly disables MFA, restores pre-MFA SECURITY DEFINER SQL, removes MFA policies, triggers, public/private functions and MFA tables, then reloads PostgREST. It is an explicit rollback, not an automatic Supabase rollback.
- The initiating actor and exact failed check are not included in schema_migrations; no specific failed pre-rollback check is proven by this record. Do not invent one.
- SQL state verified after rollback: configuration absent, 0 MFA policies, 0 MFA functions. 128 pre-existing public RLS policies, 77 triggers, 43 SECURITY DEFINER functions, 10 active cron jobs.
- app-agent-tools was restored from the stored exact production source snapshot; version number incremented but its two files match baseline byte-for-byte. All other 36 Edge Functions matched the backed-up checksums. PR #222 remains open.
- History is now mirrored under `supabase/migrations/` for **all four** applied operations; never rerun the original three merely because MFA objects are absent.
- Backups: `safety/mfa-production-snapshot-20261018`. Do not roll back the Amazon PII country guard, purge tombstones, leases, or auth resilience.

## Safe release structure: one phase per turn
**Phase A — SQL only (NOT STARTED):**
- Obtain explicit user approval for Phase A. Create a *new* versioned forward migration for MFA reinstallation, instead of reusing already-applied migration versions; make the first SQL transaction set and assert enabled=false, and be careful about name collisions with restored original functions/policies.
- Preflight migration history exact matching, complete rollback snapshot and service health, then apply SQL and test real active admin and ordinary authenticated AAL1 claims inside ROLLBACK, startup RPCs and primary table reads, and cron/worker/0 Auth 5xx.
- Journal exact SQL version, timestamp, before/after checks, rollback decision, and stop at end of turn. If any baseline regression, roll back promptly and journal.

**Phase B — Edge, at most 3–4 functions per turn (NOT STARTED):**
- Compare each actual deployed function and its shared dependencies against the pinned snapshot and new branch. Deploy a small batch, preserve verify_jwt and internal-service bypass, validate representative requests and worker/crons/5xx. Journal functions + new version + results and stop at end of turn.
- Resume only after the user approves the next batch. Do not redeploy automatic workers unless the actual bundle needs a compatible change.

**Phase C — frontend (NOT STARTED):**
- Merge #222 only after CI green on reconciled main and all Edge batches verified; confirm Vercel deployment/rollback target. User tests live login/refresh/logout before any pilot.
- Production Auth: TOTP enabled (max 10 factors), phone disabled, AAL1 sessions expire after 15 minutes when unchallenged with an enrolled factor. Login must promptly show the TOTP challenge.
- No global AAL2 activation without separate approval.

## CI
The previous pre-rollback branch commit `bea4b22476bb` passed build, Auth tests, MFA GoTrue/Vault integration. The newly archived historical rollback migration can execute during a disposable full migration reset and erase the MFA schema before integration scenarios. **Current branch CI must therefore be rerun and corrected safely before authorizing Phase A.** Never represent the old CI as green for the new commit.

## Current action
Only recorded exact rollback SQL in the repository. A CI workflow change to test forward migration and rollback separately was blocked by tooling; no CI green result or deployment is claimed.
